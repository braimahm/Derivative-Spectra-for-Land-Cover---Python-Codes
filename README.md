# Derivative-Spectra-for-Land-Cover---Python-Codes
I developed these codes to compute the derivatives of field reflectance data. I developed these codes because we
previously had to process portion of the data in excell before continuing the rest of the process in spss. 
This codes prevents human induced errors because we use python packages instead of tedious and multi step excel computations
I personally collected the data from field sites in Canton, Ohio. I used the Fieldspec4 Spectroradiometer.
